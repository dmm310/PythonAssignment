PyBank

The python code in main.py analyzes financial gains and losses from a csv
file. The data spans an 86 month long period. The analysis focuses mainly 
on the increases and decreases in a given month and not on the totals at 
the end of each month. 

I used functions to calculate and help print the information required. The 
functions are listed at the top of main.py. Included in the totals function 
is a dictionary to store data that I could then use later in the code. This 
was the hardest part of the assignment. A tutor helped me to write the 
funtions. It is eye opening how useful they are.  

Some code that I tried that did not end up working for this assignment is 
listed at the end of the main.py document under, "Code not used in the end."

Another file included in this upload is the output of main.py titled, 
"Output.txt". The original csv file is also stored in the Resources folder.

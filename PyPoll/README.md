PyPoll

The python code in main.py analyzes poll data from an election in a csv file. 
are 3 candidates whose votes are compared to each others. The output displays 
each candidate's name, the number and percentage of votes they received, and 
the winner of the election. 

I used functions to calculate and help print the information required. The 
functions are listed at the top of main.py. Included in the totals function 
is a dictionary to store data that I could then use later in the code. This 
was the hardest part of the assignment. A tutor helped me to write the funtions. 
It is eye opening how useful they are.  

Some code that I tried that did not end up working for this assignment is listed
at the end of the main.py document under, "Code not used in the end."

Another file included in this upload is the output of main.py titled, "Output.txt".
The original csv file is also stored in the Resources folder.
